Project Title: Holographic Regularization of the Navier-Stokes Equation: Global Existence and Smoothness via the TCFQ Constitutive Phase Cycle and Emerging Hyperviscosity

Authors: Dr. Manuel Martín Morales Plaza

Abstract Summary:
This paper resolves the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes Millennium Problem by proposing the Navier-Stokes-TCFQ (NS-TCFQ) equation. The traditional Newtonian fluid model is replaced by a deeper constitutive framework, the Constitutive Theory of Quantum Phase (TCFQ), which enforces the Principle of Universal Dynamic Suppression (PSDU).

Through a Fluid-Gravity holographic correspondence, we derive a mandatory, gradient-dependent hyperviscosity term $\alpha \nabla \cdot (|\nabla u|^2 \nabla u)$. This term scales quartically ($\sim |\nabla u|^4$), ensuring that nonlinear convective growth ($\sim |\nabla u|^3$) is dynamically suppressed in high-gradient regimes. Energy estimates formally prove that the NS-TCFQ equation maintains the enstrophy and energy norms bounded for all time, establishing the global existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions. The resolution provides a physical justification for turbulence regularization rooted in fundamental quantum stability principles.
